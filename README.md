# Proof of Concept – Passkeys Protocol Auditing Lab

---

## Purpose

This directory contains the **runnable Proof of Concept (PoC)** associated with
the IT Security Lab on passkeys and WebAuthn.

The PoC serves as an **interactive laboratory** used during analysis and
demonstration. It allows users to execute passkey registration and authentication
scenarios and observe their effects at runtime.

This README intentionally provides **context only**.

## Documentation Structure

To avoid duplication and maintain clear documentation boundaries:

- **Setup, execution, demonstrations, and screenshots**  
  → `doc/README.md`

- **Backend implementation details and security mechanisms**  
  → `src/README.md`

- **Project overview and navigation**  
  → repository root `README.md`

---

## Scope

This Proof of Concept is designed for **educational and analytical use**.
It is not intended for production deployment.
